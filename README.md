# Challenge 2 Accepted

#The purpose of this README is to allow the readers and viewers of the webpage to gain an understanding of my knowledge and who I am. The page serves as a way for colleagues and future employers to easily access my portfolio and contact information. I hope that the webpage shows everyone a little of who I am and what I have learned so far in UCSD's Coding Bootcamp.

## Functionality

Anyone accessing the webpage should be able to click various places on the navigation bar that direct them to places around the webpages screen. They should also be able to click on my projects and be directed to another webpage. 

## Styling

To create this webpage I used various CSS style types. I worked side by side with my stylesheet and index.html to ensure that the intended positioning and wanted styles transitioned over to the webpage. I added alt attributes to help with accessibility to anyone that needs it while accessing the web page. 

## Sources

Throughout the creation of this webpage I researched various tools to make my navigation bar more accessible and debugged my webpage using the following pages:

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42880090/a-better-way-to-space-out-navigation-bar-items


## Attempts

Although this is not the best that I feel like can be done. I attempted to try different styling tools as a new developer I hope to look back at the beginning projects and reflect how I much I have improved. I look forward to continuing my web developement journey.
